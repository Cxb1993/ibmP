\section{OpenMP Fluid Solver Results}

\subsection{Particles} 
For strong scaling, we consider $N=10^6$ particles in a box of size $256 \times 256 \times 256$. The particles are points with random forces applied to them. We concern ourselves with the time to \textit{spread} the force to the grid, \textit{solve} the fluid equations on the grid, and \textit{interpolate} back to evaluate the velocities at the points (included in this is the time to take a forward Euler step to update the points). The reason for these parameter choices is so that the time for each of these 3 core operations is similar on one core. 

Strong scaling in Table \ref{tab:ptsc} was run on \texttt{crunchy1} and results were averaged over 2 trials.

	& \multicolumn{7}{c|}{Time (s)}  \\
	& 1 Thread & 2 & 4 & 8 & 16 & 32 & 64 \\  \hline
	Spread & 17.3 & 11.2 & 10.8 &9.2 &  5.9 & 4.5 & 3.8\\      \hline
	Solve & 13.2 & 11.0  & 10.3 & 8.7 & 8.2  & 9.3 & 9.2\\      \hline
	Interpolate & 12.6 & 7.0 & 3.6 & 1.8 & 0.9 & 0.6 & 0.5\\  \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Fibers}
We do a test for fibers because the force is more localized in that case then just random particles. 8000 fibers are generated with a random starting location. All of the fibers have the same orientation/position relative to the starting location. We report the same timings as in Table \ref{tab:ptsc}, this time for fibers, in Table \ref{tab:fibsc}.
