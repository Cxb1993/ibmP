The main program is IBMain.cpp
The fiber information is all contained in ImmersedFiber.cpp
As of 04/30/2019:
1. The fiber is initialized in an ellipsoidal configuration 
  1a. It is a 3D fiber but the z coordinate is 0 everywhere. 
2. The force on the fiber is computed using fiber elasticity
3. The force is spread to the fluid. 
IMPORTANT: the spreading is done in the following stacking
fluidIndex = nX*nY*zIndex + nX*yIndex + xIndex
